    <string name="fixed_tabs">Fixed tabs display all tabs concurrently and are best used with content
        that benefits from quick pivots between tabs in fixed positions, such as switching transportation
        methods for directions in Google Maps.</string>
    <string name="fixed_tabs_2">Fixed tabs have equal width, calculated either as the view width
        divided by the number of tabs, or based on the widest tab label. To navigate between fixed
        tabs, touch the tab or swipe the content area left or right.</string>
